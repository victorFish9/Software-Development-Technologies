## How to complete this exercise

First, make sure you are working ony our personal copy of the repository. You can find more information about that in the course assignment.

Complete the exercises while reading [the course material](https://devopswithdocker.com/) and the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). You will also need to read the documentation for specific containers used in the exercises.

Copy the outputs or the commands you use based on the instructions in individual assignments. Commit and push your solutions to your repository to invoke the automated grading.

Automated grading is implemented using GitHub actions and GitHub classroom. After each commit, a new workflow will be run, and it will automatically evaluate your solutions. You can see the autograding results as well as each test and their outputs in the *actions* tab under *Classroom Autograding Workflow*. You can push new solutions as many times as necessary until the deadline of the exercise.
